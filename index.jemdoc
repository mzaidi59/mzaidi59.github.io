== About Me

As a researcher at Samsung, I have worked on a wide range of NLP tasks which include: \n
  Automatic Speech Recognition, Machine Translation (Text and Speech), Text to Speech, Question Answering, and Neural Information Retrieval. \n
  Recently, my research work has been focussed towards Open-domain Question Answering task. \n
If you are interested to know more about my work, you can have a look at my recent publications. \n
Feel free to [contact.html contact] me for any queries/discussions.
