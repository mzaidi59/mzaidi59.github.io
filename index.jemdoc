== About Me

I am a Research Engineer at the Natural Language Processing(NLP) Lab, [https://research.samsung.com/ Samsung Research] Headquarters, Seoul. I have been working in the field of Natural Language Processing. 
\n\n
Previously, I completed my undergraduate degree with a major in Electrical Engineering and minors in [https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/ Computer Science](Machine Learning) and [https://www.cgs.iitk.ac.in/ Cognitive Sciences] from [https://www.iitk.ac.in/IIT Kanpur]. I was fortunate enough to work at the Indian Space Research Organization(ISRO)- IITk Space cell with Prof. Aditya Jagannatham developing improved wireless transmission decoder for Space time trellis codes. I also worked with Prof. Ketan Rajawat on removing the sample bottleneck constraint from Online Gaussian Processes.
\n \n
I am interested in the study of languages from various perspectives such as Machine Learning and Cognitive Sciences. \n
